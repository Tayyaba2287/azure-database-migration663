# Azure Database Migration Project
**Overview**
In this project, I'll be designing and building a cloud-based database system on Microsoft Azure to demonstrate my cloud engineering skills. I'll start by setting up a production environment database and then migrate it to Azure SQL Database. This phase will include key processes like data backup, restoration, and setting up automated scheduling to solidify our data management practices.

A critical part of the project is a simulated disaster recovery scenario to test our data resilience, involving data loss and recovery strategies. I will also delve into the complexities of geo-replication and failover configurations to ensure data availability under any conditions.

Additionally, for enhanced security, I will integrate Microsoft Entra ID to define access roles, which will add a robust layer of control and protection to our system.

**A description of the project**
1. I set up a virtual machine on Azure and configured the inbound rule to allow RDP traffic on port 3389, enabling secure remote connections. I then connected to this VM from my local machine using Remote Desktop Connection and the provided RDP file. Once logged into the VM, I installed SQL Server and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) directly on it. I restored the AdventureWorks database from a backup file, using SMSS, ensuring that the system was ready for database management and operations tasks. This setup serves as the foundation.
